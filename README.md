## Getting Started üöÄ

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anddsdev/honora my-app
cd my-app
bun install
```

2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory or in the `apps/api` `apps/web` directory and add the following environment variables:

```bash
# For the API
DATABASE_URL="" # The URL of the database

ALLOWED_ORIGINS=["http://localhost:3000", "http://localhost:5173"] # The URLs that are allowed to access the API

BETTER_AUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000 # The URL of the API
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET= # The secret key for the API

# For the Web
BETTER_AUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000 # The URL of the API

RESEND_API_KEY= # The API key for the Resend service
```

3. Run the following commands to set up the database:

```bash
bun run db:generate
bun run db:migrate
bun run db:push
```

4. Start development servers:

```bash
bun run dev # Start both the API and the Web server

# or run the following commands separately:
bun run dev:api # Start the API server
bun run dev:client # Start the Web server
```

5. Open the following URLs in your browser:

- http://localhost:3000 - The API server
- http://localhost:5173 - The Web server
